## Shopping List App Proposal

### What is your project?

"Shopping List" is an application software intended to be used by a household on a regular basis to track any new item that needs to be restocked in the house. Traditionally this task has been accomplished using paper and pencil, but it is inefficient and time consuming. Instead, using the "Shopping List App" by the time the household has to go to the store, the shopping list will be already completed and accessible. 

### Wireframes!
